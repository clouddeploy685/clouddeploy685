## FAQ

#### 01. What types of applications can you deploy?

We support web applications (Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.), containers (Docker), static sites (Next.js, React, Vue), mobile applications (Swift, Dart, Kotlin), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis), and backend services (Laravel, Django, Spring Boot, .NET). If your stack is not on the list, contact us - we probably still support it!

#### 02. How do you ensure deployment security?

We use SSH key access, secret encryption (Vault/KMS), DDoS protection, and automatic vulnerability scanning. All deployments are performed in isolated environments (VMs/containers) with strict access permissions.

#### 03. Can I deploy manually or only via CI/CD?

Both! You can:

- Run manual deployments through our control panel.
- Configure CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or our built-in pipelines)

#### 04. Do you support zero-downtime deployment?

Yes! We use blue-green deployments, rolling updates, and health checks to guarantee no downtime during updates.

#### 05. How do you handle database migrations?

Automated: We run migrations in a controlled order (if you provide scripts).
Rollback-ready: Failed migrations are automatically rolled back, and we create data backups before making changes.

#### 06. What happens if deployment fails?

Automatic rollback to the last stable version.
Real-time logs for debugging issues.
Notifications (Slack/email) for immediate response.

#### 07. Can I scale my application after deployment?

Yes! Scale vertically (CPU/RAM) or horizontally (load-balanced instances) with one click. Auto-scaling based on traffic is also supported.

#### 08. How much does it cost?

Price depends on:

- Resources (CPU, RAM, storage).
- Deployment frequency (unlimited for CI/CD).
- Add-ons (monitoring, backups).

We offer pay-as-you-go and fixed monthly plans.

#### 09. Do you provide backups?

Yes! Daily automatic backups (with retention policies). You can also trigger on-demand backups before major updates.

#### 10. What types of applications can you deploy?

Register and connect your Git repository or upload code.
Configure your environment (variables, dependencies).
Deploy - instantly or via CI/CD.
